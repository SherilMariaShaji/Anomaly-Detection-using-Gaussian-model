In the discipline of data mining, anomaly detection is the discovery of data
from a variable or occurrences that do not follow a specific pattern.The use
of a machine learning algorithm aids businesses in identifying easy and effective methods for detecting anomalies.In this project we detect anomalies
from the stock market data using Gaussian Mixture Model.This is a probabilistic model based on the assumption that all data points are generated
by a mixture of Gaussian Distributions with unknown parameters.The approach is similar to clustering in Machine Learning and it is an unsupervised
learning method.
